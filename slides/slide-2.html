            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ultraviolet (UV) Light</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Butterflies can detect UV light, which is often invisible to humans. Many flowers have UV patterns on their petals that are not visible to us, but they act as guides for butterflies. These UV patterns help butterflies locate nectar-rich flowers.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Blue</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Butterflies are especially sensitive to blue. They are attracted to flowers that have blue or purple hues. Species like the </span><strong>Common Blue</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><strong>Admiral Butterfly</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are often seen visiting flowers with blue petals. These butterflies tend to favor a spectrum of blue shades, from light to dark.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Yellow</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Many butterfly species are also attracted to yellow flowers. For example, </span><strong>Swallowtail butterflies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are drawn to yellow flowers, as their visual systems are tuned to detect yellow as a prominent signal.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Red and Orange</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some butterfly species, especially those in tropical or warmer climates, are drawn to red and orange flowers. For example, the </span><strong>Red Admiral</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>Painted Lady</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are attracted to these colors. However, red is harder for most butterflies to see compared to blue and UV. Instead, they are more sensitive to the patterns and the shape of the flower rather than the color alone.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Green</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Butterflies are less sensitive to green, which is the predominant color of leaves. As a result, they are less likely to be attracted to flowers that are green, unless they exhibit other colors or patterns in the UV range.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pink and Purple</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Many butterflies are also drawn to pink and purple flowers, especially those in the </span><strong>Vanessa</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> genus, such as the </span><strong>Painted Lady</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Purple flowers often reflect UV light and can be very appealing to butterflies.</span></li>
