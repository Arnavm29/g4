               <p>The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is a milkweed butterfly (subfamily Danainae) in the family Nymphalidae. It is perhaps the best known of all North American butterflies. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 8.9–10.2 cm (3 1⁄2–4 in). The viceroy butterfly is similar in color and pattern, but is markedly smaller and has an extra black stripe across each hindwing.

                The eastern North American monarch population is notable for its multi-generational migration each fall from the United States and Canada to overwintering sites in central Mexico, where the species spends the winter in colonies. The western North American monarch population west of the Rocky Mountains migrates to overwintering sites on the California coast. Monarchs are one of the few migratory insect species and can travel up to 3,000 miles.</p>
